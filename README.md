**Language Hub**

## Features

1. **Login System with Multiple Authorization**: My website offers a secure login system with different authorization levels for students, instructors, and admins. Each user type has specific privileges and access levels.

2. **Secure Routing**: I have implemented private routes, admin routes, and instructor routes to ensure secure navigation and protect sensitive information.

3. **Stripe Payment System**: Language Hub integrates the Stripe payment system, allowing student to make secure online payments for enroll to a classes.

4. **Frontend Security and Asynchronous Data Updates**: I utilize Axios interceptor and TanStack Query to enhance frontend security and update data asynchronously.

5. **JWT Authentication**: I use JWT (JSON Web Token) for data authorization from the backend side. This ensures secure and authenticated communication between the client and server.

6. **Class Management**: Instructors can add classes, and admins have the ability to verify and provide feedback on these classes.
